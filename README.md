# Overview

`scraper.py` is a simple web-scraping python scrip that compiles data from the [Yale Review](https://yalereview.org). 

# Usage

Open the file `scraper.py`, scroll down to the last few lines, edit the `topic`, `first_page`, and `last_page` variables, as well as the file savename at the bottom. 

Open the terminal and install the necessary python libraries by running the following command: `pip isntall -r requirements.txt`. 

Then navigate (in the Terminal) to the location where you have downloaded `scraper.py` and run the program: `python scraper.py`. Note: You may need to use `python3` instead of `python` on Mac.
